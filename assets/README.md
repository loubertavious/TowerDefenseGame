# Assets Folder

This folder contains the game assets including sprites.

## Sprite Folder
- `Eye.png` - The evil eye tower sprite (replace with your actual sprite)

## File Structure
```
assets/
└── sprite/
    └── Eye.png
```

## Usage
The game will automatically load sprites from this folder. If a sprite fails to load, the game will fall back to placeholder graphics and show an error in the console.

## Adding Your Sprites
1. Replace `Eye.png` with your actual sprite file
2. Make sure the file is named exactly `Eye.png` (case-sensitive)
3. The sprite should be a PNG file for best compatibility
4. Recommended size: 32x32 or 64x64 pixels for pixel art style
